# Car-Acceptability\
In this repository, we will be developing a machine learning model to predict car acceptability based on multiple features. These can be found in the dataset file "DataAssign2.csv". The different features with their respective attributes are described below:
• Column 1: the buying price of the car (v-high, high, med, low)
• Column 2: the price of the maintenance (v-high, high, med, low)
• Column 3: number of doors (2, 3, 4, 5-more)
• Column 4: capacity in terms of persons to carry (2, 4, more)
• Column 5: the size of luggage boot (small, med, big)
• Column 6: estimated safety of the car (low, med, high)
